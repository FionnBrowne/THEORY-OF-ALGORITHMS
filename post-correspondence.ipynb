    "The Post Correspondence Problem (PCP), was introduced by Emil Post in 1946 and it is an undecidable decision problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Undecidable\n",
    "It is undecidable as there is no particular algothrim that determines whether any Post Correspondence System has an solution or not.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Decision Problem\n",
    "A decision problem is a problem that can be posed as Yes or No questions. The standard decision procedure is \" given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?\" if the remainder is 0 then the awnser is yes, otherwise no.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The PCP is used to determine wheather a collection Dominos(tiles) has a match. Escentially if we had two lists that contained N words, the aim is to find out a concatenation of these words in some sequence such that both lists yield the same result.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The PCP consists of two lists of strings that are of equal length over the input. The two lists are  $A = w1, w2, w3, .... , wn$ and$ B = x1, x2, x3, .... xn$ then there exists a non empty set of integers $i1, i2, i3, .. ,$ in such that $w1, w2, w3, .... wn = x1, x2, x3, .... xn$"
