    "The Post Correspondence Problem (PCP), was introduced by Emil Post in 1946 and represents an undecidable decision problem. In contrast, a decison problem would be a problem that can be posed as Yes or No questions. The standard decision procedure is \" given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?\" if the remainder is 0 then the awnser is yes, otherwise no.\n",
