# What is this repository
***
## This repository contains lab work from my course Theory of Algorithms & my project on the Post Correspondence Problem and the Countdown Numbers Game. These notebooks demonstrate my work on the on explaning the contents and examples of their topics.

### This project containts two main [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/):
    1.post-correspondence
    2.countdown
    
### `itertools`  [Functions creating iterators for efficient looping](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#module-itertools). 

### `post-correspondence` covers a [](), []().

### `countdown` covers a [](), []().

# Purpose of this repo:
***
### To demonstrate a deeper understanding of machine learning 

# Files:
***
### There are a few files required for this project in the Github repository

## Lab-work
***
### It contains all previous lab work done in this module that anyone can also glance over to understand the process better and see the development process.

## Quick steps
